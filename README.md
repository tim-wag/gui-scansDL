Program to download mangas from websites.

I did this just to get it to work so the code is bad and there are a lot of bugs. Don't use this. Also the number of websites is pretty low because of them use cloudflare and as I said it just wanted this to work. Try Hakuneko instead.

You can install (I think ?) the modules with ``npm install`` and use start.bat to run electron. You can build it if you want to lose time.
